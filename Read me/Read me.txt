The foundations were given us by Mr. Kevin Long in the demo.

My contributions to this website were the redesign

making the buttons work for the menu

I'm still working on the font-family in the CSS

With assistance from my classmate Daemeon Miller I was able to put shadows under my buttons

I also made it to where the menu could drop done if the tab is stretched to half when it shows 3 bars on teh side

I made sure my parks page was good as far as the buttons working

Mr. Long helped me get my searchbar working for the mountains Page

My design ideas were inspired by my classmate Jkeise Alfred
